\title{Get minimum sample size based on z-test}
\usage{
get_sample_size_ztest(
  pop,
  week,
  prev_thresh,
  power = 0.8,
  n_min = 10,
  n_max = 1000,
  df_post
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pop}{Population ID (integer or character) for which to calculate the required sample size.}

\item{week}{A single time point (week) at which sampling will occur.}

\item{prev_thresh}{Prevalence threshold to test against (null hypothesis: prevalence = \code{prev_thresh}).}

\item{power}{Desired statistical power (default is \code{0.8}).}

\item{n_min}{Minimum sample size to begin the search (default is \code{10}).}

\item{n_max}{Maximum sample size to search (default is \code{1000}).}

\item{df_post}{A data frame of posterior allele frequencies as returned by \code{\link{get_posterior_prev}}.
Must include columns \code{pop}, \code{week}, \code{p}, and \code{post}.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector with the minimum required sample size, or \code{NULL} if no sample size
within the specified range achieves the desired power.
}
\description{
Calculates the minimum sample size required to achieve a desired statistical power for detecting
whether prevalence exceeds a specified threshold using a one-sample z-test of proportions.
Power is computed based on the posterior predictive distribution of allele frequencies.
