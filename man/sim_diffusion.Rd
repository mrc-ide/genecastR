\title{Simulate from a diffusion approximation to the Wright-Fisher model}
\usage{
sim_diffusion(s, p0, sigma, dx = 0.01, t_max, n_pop)
}
\arguments{
\item{s}{Selection coefficient. A positive value favors the allele, negative values represent deleterious effects.}

\item{p0}{Initial allele frequency (between 0 and 1).}

\item{sigma}{Diffusion standard deviation. Controls the strength of genetic drift.}

\item{dx}{Discretization step size for the allele frequency space (default is 0.01).}

\item{t_max}{Number of generations to simulate.}

\item{n_pop}{Number of independent populations (replicates) to simulate.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
\describe{
  \item{pop}{Population (replicate) ID, from 1 to \code{n_deme}.}
  \item{t}{Generation number, from 1 to \code{t_max}.}
  \item{p}{Allele frequency (discretized), between 0 and 1.}
}
}
\description{
Simulates allele frequency trajectories using a diffusion approximation to the Wright-Fisher model,
incorporating selection and drift. Allele frequencies evolve as a discrete approximation to a continuous diffusion process.
