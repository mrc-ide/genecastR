Description: A package for estimating the strength of selection from allele prevalence 
    data observed over time. Uses a hidden Markov model and Bayesian MCMC to infer and 
    predict allele frequency trajectories under genetic drift. Also includes tools to 
    support study design, such as sample size and power calculations.
