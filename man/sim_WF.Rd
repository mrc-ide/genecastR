\title{Simulate from a Wright-Fisher model}
\usage{
sim_WF(
  s,
  p0,
  N,
  generations,
  n_pop,
  t_start = as.Date("2020-01-01"),
  t_step = 7
)
}
\arguments{
\item{s}{Selection coefficient (yearly units). A positive value favours the
allele, negative values represent deleterious effects.}

\item{p0}{Initial allele frequency (between 0 and 1).}

\item{N}{Effective population size (number of diploid individuals).}

\item{generations}{Number of generations to simulate.}

\item{n_pop}{Number of independent populations (replicates) to simulate.}

\item{t_start}{Date of first generation.}

\item{t_step}{Number of days between generations.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
\describe{
  \item{pop}{Population (or replicate) ID, from 1 to \code{n_pop}.}
  \item{gen}{Generation number, from 1 to \code{generations}.}
  \item{t}{Date of each generation.}
  \item{p}{Allele frequency in that population and generation.}
}
}
\description{
Simulates allele frequency trajectories over time using the Wright-Fisher
model with selection and genetic drift. Each trajectory represents a
population evolving independently under the same parameters.
}
\details{
Note - the selection coefficient (\code{s}) is in units of years. The
parameter \code{t_step} sets the number of days per generation.
