\title{Get power under a z-test}
\usage{
get_power_ztest(pop, t_samp, n_samp, prev_thresh, df_post)
}
\arguments{
\item{pop}{Population ID (integer or character) for which to compute power.}

\item{t_samp}{A single time point (generation) at which sampling will occur.}

\item{n_samp}{A single scalar specifying the number of individuals to be sampled.}

\item{prev_thresh}{Prevalence threshold to test against (null hypothesis: prevalence = \code{prev_thresh}).}

\item{df_post}{A data frame of posterior allele frequencies as returned by \code{\link{get_posterior_prev}}.
Must include columns \code{pop}, \code{t}, \code{p}, and \code{post}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with a single value: the estimated power (probability of detecting a significant deviation
from \code{prev_thresh} under the posterior predictive distribution).
}
\description{
Calculates the statistical power to detect whether allele prevalence exceeds a specified threshold
using a one-sample z-test of proportions. Power is defined as the probability that a future sample
would yield a statistically significant result (two-sided test at \code{alpha = 0.05}). The function
accounts for uncertainty in the true prevalence using a posterior distribution over allele frequencies.
