\title{Sample from a simulated prevalence trajectory}
\usage{
sample_prev(df_sim, df_sample)
}
\arguments{
\item{df_sim}{A data frame of simulated allele frequency trajectories,
typically from \code{sim_WF()} or \code{sim_diffusion()}. Must include
columns \code{pop}, \code{gen}, and \code{p}.}

\item{df_sample}{A data frame specifying sampling points, with columns
\code{pop}, \code{gen}, and \code{n_samp} (number of individuals sampled
per population and generation).}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\describe{
  \item{pop}{Population ID.}
  \item{t}{Date of sampling}
  \item{n_samp}{Number of individuals sampled at that time point.}
  \item{n_pos}{Number of positive (allele-carrying) individuals sampled (binomial draw).}
}
}
\description{
Samples observed allele prevalence from a simulated trajectory by drawing
from a binomial distribution, based on the true simulated allele frequencies
and a specified number of sampled individuals.
