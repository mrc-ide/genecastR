\title{Simulate from a Wright-Fisher model}
\usage{
sim_WF(s, p0, N, week_max, n_pop)
}
\arguments{
\item{s}{Selection coefficient. A positive value favours the allele, negative values represent deleterious effects.}

\item{p0}{Initial allele frequency (between 0 and 1).}

\item{N}{Effective population size (number of diploid individuals).}

\item{week_max}{Number of generations to simulate, where a week is a single generation (valid under a scaled effective population size).}

\item{n_pop}{Number of independent populations (replicates) to simulate.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
\describe{
  \item{pop}{Population (replicate) ID, from 1 to \code{n_pop}.}
  \item{week}{Week number, from 1 to \code{max_weeks}.}
  \item{p}{Allele frequency in that population and generation.}
}
}
\description{
Simulates allele frequency trajectories over time using the Wright-Fisher model with selection and genetic drift.
Each trajectory represents a population evolving independently under the same parameters.
