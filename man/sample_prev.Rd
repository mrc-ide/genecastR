\title{Sample from a simulated prevalence trajectory}
\usage{
sample_prev(df_sim, df_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{df_sim}{A data frame of simulated allele frequency trajectories, typically from \code{sim_WF()} or \code{sim_diffusion()}.
Must include columns \code{pop}, \code{week}, and \code{p} (true frequency).}

\item{df_data}{A data frame specifying sampling points, with columns \code{pop}, \code{week}, and \code{n_samp}
(number of individuals sampled per population and time point).}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\describe{
  \item{pop}{Population ID.}
  \item{week}{Week of study.}
  \item{n_samp}{Number of individuals sampled at that time point.}
  \item{n_pos}{Number of positive (allele-carrying) individuals sampled (binomial draw).}
}
}
\description{
Samples observed allele prevalence from a simulated trajectory by drawing from a binomial distribution,
based on the true simulated allele frequencies and a specified number of sampled individuals.
